         * This beauty here, does help me to get a remote connection to the
         * mysql server installed on my phone via Termux. I need to document carefully
         * what i did to make it work, can be very useful on the future:
         * 1. Change the mysqld config files to allow TCP/IP requests from another
         * hosts than the default localhost. The file itself is located (in Termux):
         *  data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/my.cnf
         * You should look for the route this file is saved on depending on the host O.S.
         * 1.a Usually there're multiple tweaks needed, for this specific case i had luck
         * and just needed to add this:
         *  [client]
         *  port = 3306
         *  [mysqld]
         *  port = 3306
         *  but more work could be need, check these for more insight:
         *  https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/configure-mariadb-server-on-centos/
         *  https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-do-i-enable-remote-access-to-mysql-database-server.html
         * 2. Now MySQL is ready to listen petitions, we should create users with permissions to do that.
         * I needed to make it works fast, so i just gave to the default root account privileges to operate
         * remotely, but this is not recomended:
         * #Execute these queries on the host.
         *   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
             FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
         *  Taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23733734/how-to-enable-remote-access-of-mysql-in-centos
         * Restart the server after doing this.
         * 3. Coming back into this class, to create the Connection object, we're going to need three things:
         * - an privileged enough user (root for this example)
         * - the password of that user (the one used in the SQL query below this)
         * - the server's URL
         * 3.a the server's URL is assembled with the device's public IP, a port and the specific DB we're interesed
         * to access. I got the IP adress following this
         *  https://linuxhint.com/expose_mysql_server_internet/
         * Keep in mind this is a public IP's address, do not share it mindlessly
         * 3.b Renember the 'port = 3306', weÂ´re going to use that port for assemble the URL.
